Dear Ilsang,

Thank you for your note. We have carefully checked all of the fields in the Observing Tool, and are ready to resubmit. However, before we do, I want to touch base with you regarding our programâ€™s time constraints. 

We are requesting two epochs, one (Epoch 1) to be executed ASAP, the second (Epoch 2) to be executed 7-12 days after the first.

Epoch 1 consists of observations in three bands: Band 7, Band 8, and Band 9. Epoch 2 consists of observations in two bands: Band 6 and Band 7. It is important for the bands to be observed as close as possible in time to each other. 

We have included this information in the Technical Justification, but I want to make sure that it is clear. Would you mind checking the OPT and letting me know if the information we have provided so far will enable the observations to be scheduled in this way? 

Thank you and best wishes,

Anna
